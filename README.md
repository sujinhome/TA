# Teaching Assistant

You can check some codes I used when working as a teaching assistant. These codes can be helpful when managing attendance and homework scores in class with a big number of students.  

I used attendance.R and homework.R when I was a TA in Seminar on Financial Economy, Departmet of Economics, Seoul National University. 

<b>attendance.R</b> is a r script that allows merging a class register file with zoom participation records using regular expressions.
The regular expressions are for Korean names in this r script. You can also use it by changing regular expressions in your language. 

<b>homework.R</b> is a r script that allows to check whether a student handed in his or her homework or not.
